This is a basic post in the `_posts` directory.  I set up this Jekyll blog more or less following the instructions at the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] and [Jekyll Boostrap][jekyll-bootstrap], but am keeping it in a separate folder on my file system and manually pushing the _site directory into my website.  I use `jekyll serve` to preview posts before moving them.

New posts in the `_posts` directory follow the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.markdown` and include the necessary front matter.
