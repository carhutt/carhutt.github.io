    <p>I have some thoughts about this <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">Wait But Why post</a>.  Actually, I have some thoughts about all of Wait But Why, but this post is big and long and provides examples of almost all the things that drive me nuts about Wait But Why, so we’ll focus on this one post.</p>

<p>TL;DR — Elon Musk is pretty cool, I guess, and new technology is cool, but the casually materialistic philosophy that drives Musk and Urban is a mind-destroying (and possibly soul-destroying) trap.</p>

<h1 id="things-i-liked">Things I liked</h1>
<p>I have a lot of respect for the work that Tim Urban put into writing the scientific bits of this post, and I learned a lot of interesting factoids about brain-machine interfaces and the current state of neurotechnology.</p>

<h1 id="criticisms">Criticisms</h1>

<h2 id="this-is-really-just-that">“This is <em>really just</em> that”</h2>

<p>Here are some quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Research scientist Paul Merolla described it to me: …“you just see a cup—but what your eyes are seeing is really just a bunch of pixels.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But this is what we all are. You look in the mirror and see your body and your face and you think that’s you—but that’s really just the machine you’re riding in. What you actually are is a zany-looking ball of jello.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The you you think of when you think of yourself—it’s really mainly your cortex. Which means you’re actually a napkin.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>…at the most literal level, Elon’s right about people being computers. At its simplest definition, a computer is an object that can store and process data—which the brain certainly is. <em><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html">Source</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A word is simply an approximation of a thought—buckets that a whole category of similar-but-distinct thoughts can all be shoved into.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="psuedo-history">Psuedo-history</h2>

<h2 id="elons-shill">Elon’s shill</h2>

<h2 id="materialism">Materialism</h2>

<h1 id="poetry">Poetry</h1>

<h1 id="what-i-think-is-interesting">What I think is interesting</h1>

<p>(In general, I take issue with Tim Urban’s approach to philosophy.  I don’t want to get too carried away with this part of my criticism, especially since I’m just some dude and he’s just some dude with a bigger blog, but browsing the posts on his blog tagged “philosophy” is…disappointing.  They aren’t philosophy, they’re weird squirming attempts to avoid the nutso metaphysical consequences of philosophical materialism.)</p>
