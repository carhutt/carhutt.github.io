    <p>I have some thoughts about this <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">Wait But Why post</a>.  Actually, I have some thoughts about all of Wait But Why, but this post is big and long and provides examples of almost all the things that drive me nuts about Wait But Why, so we’ll focus on this one post.</p>

<p>TL;DR — Elon Musk is pretty cool, I guess, and new technology is cool, but the casually materialistic philosophy that drives Musk and Urban is a mind-destroying (and possibly soul-destroying) trap.</p>

<h2 id="things-i-liked">Things I liked</h2>
<p>I have a lot of respect for the work that Tim Urban put into writing the scientific bits of this post, and I learned a lot of interesting factoids about brain-machine interfaces and the current state of neurotechnology.</p>

<p>Also, there was this one quote that I thought was genuinely insightful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…the progress of science, business, and industry are all at the whim of the progress of engineering.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="criticisms">Criticisms</h2>

<h3 id="this-is-really-just-that">“This is <em>really just</em> that”</h3>

<p>Here are some quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Research scientist Paul Merolla described it to me: …“you just see a cup—but what your eyes are seeing is really just a bunch of pixels.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But this is what we all are. You look in the mirror and see your body and your face and you think that’s you—but that’s really just the machine you’re riding in. What you actually are is a zany-looking ball of jello.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The you you think of when you think of yourself—it’s really mainly your cortex. Which means you’re actually a napkin.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>…at the most literal level, Elon’s right about people being computers. At its simplest definition, a computer is an object that can store and process data—which the brain certainly is. <em>(<a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html">Source</a>)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A word is simply an approximation of a thought—buckets that a whole category of similar-but-distinct thoughts can all be shoved into.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s what language is—your brain has executed a compression algorithm on thought, on concept transfer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every single one of these sentences is an intellectually lazy pile of crap that makes me want to scream and punch someone.  Screaming and punching is not my normal response to people being wrong in public, but in this case it is, for a couple of reasons.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit#Bullshit_asymmetry_principle">bullshit asymmetry principle</a> says that “the amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it”, which means that to properly explain why the quotes above are <em>so wrong</em> would require ten times the amount of work Tim Urban put into his article, and he was probably getting paid for it.</li>
  <li><a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2017/02/from-disneyism-to-onlyism.html">“Onlyism”</a> drives me nuts because it’s the first step toward thinking of yourself as a robot and seeing people as meatsacks.  Reductionist definitions of personhood and language, even if presented flippantly, are spiritual poison.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="other-deceptive-rhetoric">Other deceptive rhetoric</h3>

<p>Also the “Communication Speed Today” bar chart makes me mad, because it does not acknowledge that is comparing incommensurable things.  “Communication” means something completely different when you are talking about people than it does when talking about digital information going through wires or wifi.  One is information in the most abstract Shannon-Weaver sense; the other is something we don’t actually have a handle on.</p>

<p>Maybe low-bandwidth, lossy communication is a feature of the human condition, not a bug.</p>

<p>This is thought-provoking: “as imaginative as we think we are, our imaginations only really have our life experience as their toolkit, and these concepts [the brain interface and the abilities it would give you, and artificial general intelligence] are both totally novel. It’s like trying to imagine a color you’ve never seen.”  What if this is only the case with the technologies being speculated about in this article and is not the case with all the other historical and established technologies that the article has talked about?</p>

<p>I mean, obviously the writer thinks no, the technologies we have were also unimaginable at some point—“Remember—George Washington died when he saw 2017. And our future will be unfathomably shocking to us.”—but I don’t see why.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the insanity part of it shouldn’t be the reason it’s hard to believe. Remember—George Washington died when he saw 2017. And our future will be unfathomably shocking to us. The only difference is that things are moving even faster now than they were in George’s time.
The concept of being blown away by the future speaks to the magic of our collective intelligence—but it also speaks to the naivety of our intuition. Our minds evolved in a time when progress moved at a snail’s pace, so that’s what our hardware is calibrated to. And if we don’t actively override our intuition—the part of us that reads about a future this outlandish and refuses to believe it’s possible—we’re living in denial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just bald assertion, without even an attempt at proof.  “Our future will be unfathomably shocking to us”, apparently so shocking that we will <em>literally die</em>.  Uh, no, I really don’t think so.  Let me share an anecdote.</p>

<p>When I was in college I dated a girl who worked on the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_the_Spear"><em>End of the Spear</em></a>, about the five American missionaries who were killed by members of the Waodani tribe in the jungles of Ecuador.  There’s a lesser-known sequel to <em>End of the Spear</em>, called <a href="http://thegrandfathers.com/"><em>The Grandfathers</em></a>.  It’s about a warm relationship that forms between (a) a grandson of one of the missionaries and (b) one of the tribe members who killed his grandfather.  I bring it up just because it helps show how completely absurd Tim Urban’s blather about how George Washington would die of tech-induced astonishment really is.  Mincaye had a lot farther to come than George Washington, and he did just fine.  In the film (and maybe also in some bonus footage to <em>End of the Spear</em>, I don’t remember), Mincaye, the member of the Waodani tribe, flies in an airplane and spends some time in the suburbs in the United States.  He’s pretty unfazed, and mostly finds the ways people use technology funny.  For example, he thinks it’s hilarious that you can go to a big building full of food and take whatever you want home with you if you just show a man a piece of plastic.  And, well, yeah, it is pretty funny.  Would Mincaye have trouble adapting completely to life in the suburbs?  Probably.  But did he see that life in the suburbs—and remember, it was like going forward 2,000 years in a time machine for him—as the end of a “very intense road” leading to a “very intense place”?  No.  He saw it as just a bunch of people, doing more or less the things that people do, with some really weird hilarious behaviors that only sort of made sense.  And I think that’s probably where we’re actually heading, although I’m open to the possibility that I might be wrong about that.</p>

<p>And this question of where we’ve been and where we’re going leads to my next bone that I have to pick with Tim Urban:</p>

<h3 id="psuedo-history">Psuedo-history</h3>

<p>The not-even-wrong reductionist caricatures of language and human nature that Urban relies on are tied up in his history of technology and humanity, which is wrong in a more demonstrable and straight-forward way.</p>

<p>He starts with trying to explain how language came about.  This is unfortunate, because no one really knows how language came about.  It’s not just me saying that no one knows, either: Bill Bryson, in his book <em>The Mother Tongue: English And How It Got That Way</em> writes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have not the faintest idea whether the first words spoken were uttered 20,000 years ago or 200,000 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a couple of pages later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the greatest mysteries of prehistory is how people in widely separated places suddenly and spontaneously developed the capacity for langauge at roughly the same time.  It was as if people carried around in their heads a genetic alarm clock that suddenly went off all around the world and led different groups in widely scattered places on every continent to create languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tim Urban, on the other hand, has it all figured out.  First there were monkeys, then the monkeys figured out how to yell nouns at one another, and then one fine day they had a fully developed language.  This just-so story about shouting nouns [and then magic happens] and then human language exists has a lot of problems.  It’s like saying that one day an engineer discovered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czochralski_process">Czochralski process</a> and then one fine day everyone was using Google.  Urban doesn’t even admit that no one really has any idea of what that [and then magic happens] process was like.  (On the other hand, we are capable of telling the story that goes from the Czochralski process to Google, even though it’s complicated.  And it only took a few decades, not millenia.)</p>

<p>there just <em>aren’t</em> any practical, technological things in Democritus or Lucretius, much less Heraclitus or Herodotus.  And it’s not like there were other, less well-known authors who were writing a bunch of technical manuals in classical antiquity, either.</p>

<p>Also the “Communication Speed Today” bar chart makes me mad, because it does not acknowledge that is comparing incommensurable things.  “Communication” means something completely different when you are talking about people than it does when talking about digital information going through wires or wifi.</p>

<p>And let’s think about this: maybe low-bandwidth, lossy communication is a feature of the human condition, not a bug.  Same for forgetting.</p>

<h3 id="materialism">Materialism</h3>

<p>In general, I take issue with Tim Urban’s approach to philosophy.  I don’t want to get too carried away with this part of my criticism, especially since I’m just some dude and he’s just some dude with a bigger blog, but browsing the posts on his blog tagged “philosophy” is…disappointing.  They aren’t philosophy, they’re weird squirming attempts to avoid the nutso metaphysical consequences of philosophical materialism.  (Those consequences consisting mainly of <em>despair</em>, in case you were wondering.)  To put it another way, Tim Urban’s bloviation about philosophy and having a good life read to me like he’s doing his level best to be a normal friendly dude while what’s constantly spinning around in his head is this:
